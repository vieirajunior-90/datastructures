# Data Structures in Java (In construction... ðŸš§)

This a repo for my learning, I'm going to put the code here as I've been learning from books, articles and videos.

Yeah! I know there's a lot of code on GitHub about data structures, but I take this as a great oportunity to learn about it and code on my own. 
Thereby, my implementations probably won't be the best, nevertheless I'd like to try my own solutions as way of practicing.

The following links will take you to good sources of data structures.

Below, links for some solutions.
There's both code and test for the respectives algorithms.
